# Coursera-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This repo contains assignments for the course
This course made me understand :
- how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
- how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- how to use neural style transfer to generate art.
- how be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.
